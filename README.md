# PLCProjects
This repository is for all the PLC projects I have done at school. They are all done in Automation Studio 4.12; The selected HW is X20 CP 1585. This controller is available at the PLC Laboratory at the University of Applied Sciences Upper Austria.  
The exercises that are done were taken from "Skript Automatisierungstechnik" 6th edition by Markus SÃ¼tterlin. For each exercise, a PVI process simulation was provided that helped with the testing.
Here, in each folder, the instructions and the codes are provided. The PVI process simulation could not be provided since the permission of their usage was exclusive.
